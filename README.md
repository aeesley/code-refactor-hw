NAME
Code Refactor Homework Assignment

DESCRIPTION
This is the completed 01-HTML CSS Git homework assignment for Northwestern's Coding Bootcamp during first week of class.

The purpose of this assignment is a support ticket simulation where I am improving code to make an existing agency's website more accessible, and search engine optimized. The code has been altered with semantic tags, and css has been restructured to provide a more web-friendly and long lasting DRY experience.

PROJECT STATUS
Complete and submitted via GitLab.
